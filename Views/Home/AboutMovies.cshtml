    <p class="lead">
        As a team, we chose movies as our shared hobby because films are an easy way to relax,
        connect with friends, and experience different stories and cultures in just a couple of hours.

            <h4>Why Our Team Enjoys Movies</h4>
            <p>
                We don’t all have the exact same taste, but that makes movie nights more interesting.
                Some of us like sci-fi and action, others like drama or animation. Together we enjoy
                comparing what we noticed in a film: the story, the acting, the visuals, and the music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Movies are also a good conversation starter. After watching something, we end up
                talking about the message of the film, how it connects to real life, and whether
                we would recommend it to other people.

            <h4 class="mt-4">A Very Short History of Movies</h4>
            <p>
                The idea of movies started in the late 1800s when inventors experimented with devices
                that could show a series of pictures quickly to create the illusion of motion. Over time,
                this turned into full films shown in theaters.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Silent films (1890s–1920s):</strong> Black-and-white movies with no recorded sound. Music was often played live in the theater.</li>
                <li><strong>Classic Hollywood (1930s–1950s):</strong> Studios like MGM and Warner Bros. produced big films with famous actors and clear “hero vs. villain” stories.</li>
                <li><strong>New ideas and blockbusters (1960s–1980s):</strong> Directors experimented with storytelling, and large blockbuster movies like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Jaws</em> changed the industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital and streaming era (1990s–today):</strong> Computer graphics, high-quality cameras, and streaming services let people watch movies anywhere and anytime.</li>

                    <p class="small">
                        In this project, we created a simple movie database using SQL Server and
                        Entity Framework Core. Our <strong>Movies</strong> page reads from the database
                        and shows a list of films in an HTML table.

                    <p class="small">
                        Each record stores basic information:

                        <li>Runtime in minutes</li>
                        <li>Rating (for example, out of 10)</li>

                        This is a small sample today, but the same structure could be extended into a
                        full watchlist or recommendation site in the future.
