                <h5 class="mt-4">Why Movies?</h5>
                <p>
                    Movies are one of my favorite ways to relax and also learn. I enjoy seeing how stories are
                    structured, how characters change, and how technical elements like editing and music support
                    the emotion of each scene. Building MoviesHub let me mix that hobby with my interest in
                    software development.
